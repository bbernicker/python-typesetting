    # (show that "War" looked bad)

    # paragraphs: beautiful
    # boxes and glue -> dynamic programming

    # why?
    # different input forms
    # real language rather than macro language
    # (show what a macro language is)
    # (mention backslash?)
    # be in control

    # Paragraph layout: can it simply return its decision, given "width"?
    # No, because next column might be different width.
    # So it needs a way to ask for new pages/columns as it goes along.
    # And it will do something like:

    simple_slide('I wanted to improve upon TeX')
    simple_slide('(text, width) ‚Üí paragraph',
                 '(paragraph, height) ‚Üí page')

                 'so we know when it has filled one',
                 'column and moves to the next')
# by having paragraph ask for more columns as it needed them.
# lay_out_paragraph(width, height, y, ...)
# Column = NamedTuple(..., 'width, height')
# lay_out_paragraph(column, y, ...)
# each time you need a line:
# height = ... # compute space needed
# if y + height > column.height:
#     # ask for another column
# How do we do that?
# layout.next_column() OR column.next() OR next_column(column)
# lay_out_paragraph(column, y, next_column, ...)
# Why? To avoid Premature Object Orientation!
# Looking at options:
# layout.next_column() OR column.next() OR next_column(column)
# ask WHY?
# What necessity requires the verb you need
# to be attached to a noun?
# Unless the answer is, "because you can't avoid it", skip it.
# So my arguments are coming together
# lay_out_paragraph(column, y, next_column, ...)
# What about the return value?
# Can the routine simply draw on the page when it's done?
# No!
# Because we need speculation.
# ... (put existing slides here that show what headings need to do) ...
# How will the heading work?
# :add heading to column
# :ask paragraph to lay itself out
# :if paragraph's first line's column != column:
# :    remove the paragraph
# :    remove ourselves
# :    column = next_column()
# :    re-add heading
# :    re-add paragraph
# How?
# generators?
# iterators?
# lists of lists?
# linked list!
# Column = NamedTuple(..., 'width, height')
# Line = NamedTuple(..., 'previous_line column y')

#                    col5     col6    col6    col6
#                    line9 ‚Üê line1 ‚Üê line2 ‚Üê line3

#                    HEADING  P1      P2      P3
# We can run any number
# of speculative layout steps
# and when we keep one, Python
# decrements the refcounts
# and discards all the rest!
# so we have a linked list
# we need to pass it so that callee can add to it.
# lay_out_paragraph(column, y, line, next_column, ...)
# simplify / eliminate redundnancy / something? yes! simplify!
# lay_out_paragraph(xxxx column, xxx y, line, next_column, ...)

# lay_out_paragraph(line, next_column, ...)
# yay
# SYMMMETRY: we started out passing one thing returning another
# but now we are passed a `line` and later we return a different `line`
# Line = NamedTuple(..., 'previous_line column y')
# so we now know how to return speculative layout.
# But how does the heading invoke the paragraph to make it do layout?
# Reality: markdown or rst ‚Üí list of calls
# actions = [
#     (chapter_title, 'Intro'),
#     (paragraph, 'hobbits'),
#     (heading, '1. title'),
#     (paragraph, 'hobbits'),
#     (paragraph, 'hobbits'),
#     (heading, '2. on pipe-weed'),
#     (paragraph, 'hobbits'),
#     ...
# ]
# decision: pass in list and index
#   lay_out_paragraph(actions, a, ...)
# could try to hide it, but.
# so the paragraph lays out its content and is done.
# but the heading asks the following paragraph to work too.
# how can it return finished work?
# return a + i; can either do its own work, or return several subseq.
# `return line_n, a+1`
# so how does our arg list look
# lay_out_paragraph(actions, a, line, next_column, ...)
# even though half our routines are going to ignore `actions`
# and return `a+1`
# arg list is long because it's general
# it handles the case where you have to call n subseq steps
# idea: maybe make an EXCEPTION for simple layout routines
# that aren't going to look at `actions` and always return `a+1`
# 1990s: would have introspected arguments magic!
# 2000s: would have registered simple and complex
# 2010s: would have defined decorator to convert
# @simple
# could be:
# def simple(callable):
#     def wrapper(actions, a, line, next_column, *args):
#         line2 = callable(line, next_column, *args)
#         return a + 1, line2
#     return wrapper
# what did I decide?
# NO NO NO
# Keep all the routines the same
# The very simplest routine
# single_line(actions, a, line, next_column, ...)
#     ...
#     return a + 1, line2
# why?
# because I learn my code by re-reading
# if I have 5 sophisticated routines
# and 5 simple ones,
# and I give the simple ones an exception,
# 1. I now have two calling conventions rather than one
# 2. I only have half the number of examples of each one
# A single calling convention brings SYMMETRY
# (show "how heading works") <- (what?)
# BONUS ROUND
# inside para: multi calls to inner p. Looks like heading!
# so, shouldn't this be its own action in the list?
# BUT: needs to subvert LAST line. How? Twiddle?
# Fake params? Fake column? That's like a framework?
# NO-
# All these routines have the same logic. Over and over. [show logic?]
# That routine is going to be making a decision you want to control.
# Where do you want to be when a big decision is made.
# WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE?
# In the room where it happens...
# I had been imagining:
# single_line(actions, a, line, next_column, ...)
#     ...
#     column2 = next_column(line.column)
# but what I really wanted was to take control away:
# single_line(actions, a, line, next_line, ...)
#     ...
#     line2 = next_line(leading=2, height=12)
# so you can subvert it
# (TODO: look up how I actually do this. How does it work?)
# And why are we able to do that?
# Becuase of avoiding Premature OO!
# Otherwise it would be difficult to replace one method of an object;
# would have to use Gang of Four Decorator, or monkeypatching, or worse.
# If you pass an object and need to live override a method
# you are in trouble.
# But if you pass a callable and need to tweak it?
# Very easy!
