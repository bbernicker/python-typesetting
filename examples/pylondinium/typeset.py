# A single calling convention brings SYMMETRY
# (show "how heading works") <- (what?)

# I had been imagining:
# single_line(actions, a, line, next_column, ...)
#     ...
#     column2 = next_column(line.column)
# but what I really wanted was to take control away:
# single_line(actions, a, line, next_line, ...)
#     ...
#     line2 = next_line(leading=2, height=12)
# so you can subvert it
# (TODO: look up how I actually do this. How does it work?)
# And why are we able to do that?
# Becuase of avoiding Premature OO!
# Otherwise it would be difficult to replace one method of an object;
# would have to use Gang of Four Decorator, or monkeypatching, or worse.
# If you pass an object and need to live override a method
# you are in trouble.
# But if you pass a callable and need to tweak it?
# Very easy!
# End with showing photos of book.

    # so, linked list
