    # so, linked list

    # so we no longer need to pass in y or column
    # so code started to look like:
    # (have code that combines leading, height, next_column, line)
    # and it always looks like that
    # idea: instead of next_column(), could we put this logic in next_line()?
    # so how do you find what next thing is?
    # of other alternatives, chose to pass array and index.
    # and have them pass back new index so they don't throw away layout.
    # and in case they were nondeterministic.
    # so, rule: if you lay out next element, keep the result.
    # show example list of items, and what array/a would be passed, returned.
    # TEMPTATION: special call convention for "simple" routines
    # that don't look at next.
    # (actions, a, fonts, line, next_line, ...)
    # could: introspect? register? decorate?

    # want to add next() to line instead of having next_line()
    # TODO: how do we motivate wanting to control next_line() decision?
    # do we use wanting to separate out avoid_widows_and_orphans()
    # instead of having switch because:
    # Composition is better than Configuration(?)Switches(?)
    # (^^^ [farther up] show 2 different ways para would look in actions list)
    # Isn't widow/orphan like heading logic but without a heading?
    # It's a transform applied to a paragraph.
    # If we decide, "orphan", then we need to push to next page.
    # How do we control where its next line goes?
    # Alternatives: fake line; fake column height; fake page height.
    # All of these are frameworky!
